/***************************************************
 *This is a USART library for the MSP430.
 *
 * It can provide basic USART (serial) communication for any application.
 *
 * This code is in the public domain. Feel free to do with it whatever you want.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * FOR STUDENTS:
 * 
 * This file will be given to you in an 'empty' state. The function bodies are
 * provided, but not their content. You are supposed to add the proper code
 * and complete these functions.
 * 
 * Hint 1: RTFM! The TI device datasheets contain all information necessary.
 * 
 * Hint 2: We do not expect you to write the most performant or exceptionally
 * well-engineered code, but it should work. If in doubt, sacrifice speed for
 * reliability. If you are bored, rewrite the entire library in assembler and
 * squeeze the last microsecond out of it.
 *

// Call it at any time to change the USART communication parameters.

// Receives a '\n' terminated string and writes it into a supplied buffer.
// The buffer must be guaranteed to handle at least bufflen bytes.
// Returns the number of bytes written into the buffer. (If you want)
